# sql-challenge

In this challenge I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using the online tool QuickDBD. For the data engineering portion of this project I created tables, assigned appropriate data types, assigned primary and foreign keys, and set relationships between the tables.

I then exported this ERD into the PostgreSQL format and opened it in pgAdmin, which brought in code to create all of the tables and relationships developed in QuickDBD. After running all of code to create the tables, I imported the csv files into each table.

From there, I stepped through each part of the analysis running and checking the code after each prompt to confirm the code worked and resulted in the correct data. 

This is a combination of my original work and code learned in the UMN Data Science Bootcamp.
